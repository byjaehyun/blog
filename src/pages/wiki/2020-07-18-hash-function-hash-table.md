I read ["Data Structures & Algorithms I Actually Used Working at Tech Companies"](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-i-actually-used-day-to-day/).  After reading, I just pick one thing that i want to know with details. So i choose "Hash" because it is used widely and frequently.



## What is hash function or hashing.

A hash function is any [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics) "Function (mathematics)") that can be used to map [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)") of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. [1]

Hashing could have collision where different values can be same result.  We can use space more or re-calculate for fix this collision.
