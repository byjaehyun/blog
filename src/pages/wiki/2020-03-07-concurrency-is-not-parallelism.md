Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions in progress at the same time. A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions executing simultaneously. The key concept and difference between these definitions is the phrase "in progress."
