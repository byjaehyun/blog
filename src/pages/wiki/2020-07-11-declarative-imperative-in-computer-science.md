In computer science, declarative programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. This is in contrast with [imperative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming"), which implements [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") in explicit steps.\[1]

For example. 

```
// Declarative
function getSharks(){
  var sharks = [];
  for (var i = 0; i < ...) {
    if(bla){
        sharks.add(...);
    }
  }
  return sharks;
}

// Imperative
Select * FROM animal WHERE sth='sharks';
```
