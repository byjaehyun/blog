I was feeling tired these days. It demands me a lot energy to hold both of work and study. I work as a part time job while taking two classes to get my university diploma. I just bear stuff around me, and feel like lost about what's going on.

I read the famous [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles). Some words hit me. "Thinking small is a self-fullfilling prophecy". Keep thinking big even if i am not doing my best like that. Can one idividual think big? Could that one be me?
