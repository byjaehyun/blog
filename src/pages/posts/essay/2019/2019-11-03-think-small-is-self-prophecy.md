I was feeling tired these days. It demands me a lot energy to hold both of work and study. I'm part time job as a software developer while taking two classes to get my diploma. I just bear stuff around me losing thoughts about what i want to do.

To have an Amazon interview, I read the famous [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles). Some words hit me. "Thinking small is a self-fullfilling prophecy". Do I forget to think big myself? Maybe I rest for a while, but I should always try to think big.
